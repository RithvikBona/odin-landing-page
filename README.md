The Odin Project - Landing Page Project

This project is meant to showcase my flexbox skills in order to create a appealing website that complies with a finished website design. Both HTML and CSS are heavily used in this project. The website is akin to a template and has dummy content, however it is layouted as a real website may be. I broke the page design into 4 sections, each of which I completed separately.
